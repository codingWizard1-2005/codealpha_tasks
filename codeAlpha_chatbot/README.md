PYTHON CHATBOT
In this project, i created a simple chatbot that communicates with a user using python functions, while loop and if-else satements
Chatbot gives response when user types simple request like greetings i.e "Hello" e.t.c and stops when user types bye 
so in other cases it will tell the user that it doesn't understand
